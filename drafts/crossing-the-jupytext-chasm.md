Marc Wout's [jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) is genius.

Version controlling directories which included .ipynb files was getting a bit tiresome.

I wanted the ability to keep .ipynb (or iPy-notebook-executable files of some sort) in the project directory, because they are a great way to develop new
panel/bokeh app funcitionality. So putting it in .gitignore didn't make sense.

Anyway, this *was* an issue but, despite being vaguely irksome, this was not the type of issue I was ready to [cross the chasm]() to change. 

I think of this in the context of my experience in entrepreneurship and early-stage technology sales.

But here's was I was ready to cross the chasm for. A streamlined way to prototype minimal Bokeh apps and then deploy them from the same file.
With version controlling being the delicious icing on the cake.
