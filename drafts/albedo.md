This [radiative convective model](http://12.340x.scripts.mit.edu/eaps-rc-model-12340x/RC_model/index.html) from MIT is a good example of my inspirations.

I like that the controls are relatively simple and condensed, that it stores cached model runs, and that it tells you how long to expect to run.

What I hoped to improve on were:

 1. UI responsiveness/styling
 2. "Previewability" via pop-up windows, which were in turn refernced from Apple iOS Photos editor functions
