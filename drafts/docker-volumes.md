I used this [Real Python](https://realpython.com/dockerizing-flask-with-compose-and-machine-from-localhost-to-the-cloud) tutorial, alongside this
one from [testdriven.io](https://testdriven.io/blog/dockerizing-flask-with-postgres-gunicorn-and-nginx).

Using docker-machine is great.

The hardest part for me was untangling volumes, bindings, and mounts.
